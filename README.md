# home-server
Personal Project

I'm a curious person that I want to discovery how all process development and deployment works. Looking at this point I dicide to get strongly comprehension about that and then I make the decision to create and provide my own server to my personal project application and my own process of development.

This repository just store some things I need to configure there.
